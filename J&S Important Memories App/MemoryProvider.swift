So when our third date rolled around on August 1st, I knew I just had to be with you. I still can't believe you agreed to be my girlfriend!"),
        Memory(month: 3, day: 1, year: 2014, description: "The day I proposed", whatIRemember: "I was so nervous and I couldn't imagine you saying no but I still felt like there was a chance. When you finally said yes, I could feel my heart fill up with a palpable joy"),
        Memory(month: 8, day: 1, year: 2014, description: "The day we got married", whatIRemember: "I remember I could not stop smiling all day! I couldn't believe it was finally happening and that you didn't run away! So Happy I married you!"),

I always wanted to be a dad and when we got married my heart was filled with the promise of one day having a family. Seeing James for the first time brought those emotions to their full capacity with how happy it made me. I'm so glad to have started a family with you. I am so glad we are our own little family"),
        Memory(month: 10, day: 20, year: 2016, description: "James' first birthday", whatIRemember: "Sometimes it is hard to grasp the process of growth and development. Sitting at the park with the banner you made of James on his journey at the start of each month made it abundantly clear how my son is growing. It made me so happy to see the process of him getting older"),
        Memory(month: 8, day: 1, year: 2017, description: "The day I found out we were pregnant with our second child", whatIRemember: "I remember being a pretty scary time for us financially and then when James came in with his book and shirt about being a big brother, it washed everything away. For the first time in a long time, I forgot about our worries and my heart was so happy that another little one was on the way!")
