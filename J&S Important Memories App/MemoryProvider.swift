I always wanted to be a dad and when we got married my heart was filled with the promise of one day having a family. Seeing James for the first time brought those emotions to their full capacity with how happy it made me. I'm so glad to have started a family with you. I am so glad we are our own little family"),
        Memory(month: 8, day: 1, year: 2017, description: "The day I found out we were pregnant with our second child", whatIRemember: "I remember being a pretty scary time for us financially and then when James came in with his book and shirt about being a big brother, it washed everything away. For the first time in a long time, I forgot about our worries and my heart was so happy that another little one was on the way!")
